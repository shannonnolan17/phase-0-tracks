#In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
*It is a virtual machine compared to an actual, physical server. It's a server that can be used to host websites, but several virtual servers can be hosted on the same physical server. They typically cost less, you can easily upgrade if you need more RAM or CPU, and have flexibility to choose the operating system and software you want to use.
