#jQuery Research
*I plan on googling things like "jQuery tutorial" and "getting started with jQuery"
*Try to find some examples to look at view and try to guess what they do
*Try to find some cheat sheets that can help with syntax or explaining things
*Try to find a code along tutorial to learn while doing
*See if there are jQuery docs to look through
