#jQuery Research
*I plan on googling things like "jQuery tutorial" and "getting started with jQuery"
*Try to find some examples to look at view and try to guess what they do
*Try to find some cheat sheets that can help with syntax or explaining things
*Try to find a code along tutorial to learn while doing
*See if there are jQuery docs to look through

###What worked
*I found a great really quick and easy W3 tutorial that went over the basics and had great examples
*I also found a cheatsheet that I can keep handy when I need it
*I practiced some things on W3 and played around with the features of jQuery
*Found an awesome website that has everything all in one that will be a great reference
