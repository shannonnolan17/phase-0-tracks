# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control is a system/technique that allows you to edit and track a repository of files over time. It is important and very useful in collaborative development projects because it allows multiple contributors to add/edit features independently of the source code, track those edits, incorporate those edits, and reverse/update those edits when necessary.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is essentially a copy of your master branch that allows you to work on a specific project feature without tainting/editing the master branch files. You might use a branch to work on a specific project feature or to work on a file / code feature independntly in a group project.  
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - In git, a "commit" is a save-point in a project. Any time you edit files in a project and want to create a save-point, you have to complete commits. A good commit message is specific and descriptive of what was changed.
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict is an issue that occurs when incongruous changes are made to the same line of code in a file, or when you attempt to edit a file that has previously been deleted.
