# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version control is a tool that allows you to track, progress, review, and revert changes and to creat backups. It is useful because you can find bugs easier if you look at the time stamp. You can also go back to any point in the code's history with version control to review it. It also creates a safe place for your code.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is a "copy" of a project to work on. You would use it to add features to your existing project in order to enhance it.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit is a way of saving your project and it will add a timestamp so you can use version control to go back to it. It also includes a unique ID, a message, and an author. A good commit message is one that tells people exactly what you did before you saved it.
* What is a merge conflict?
* A merging conflict occurs when two authors make conflicting changes to the same code. When this happens, git doesn't know which is correct and which to merge.
