<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
  The purpose is to give meaning to the page so that users with disabilities can easily access the page. They are also used to better divided and separate the document in a clear way to make it easier to follow. I saw <article>being very useful and probably used widely throughout the internet.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  The browsers reads the document whole from top to bottom and displays the first items first and the last items last.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  I learned how to make a snippet!! I am very excited because I will definitely be making more. I love a good shortcut!

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  The most difficult concept was the <section> tag. I was not sure when to use this vs div. I am going to research it more and find some more flowcharts like the one in the Release. Those are very helpful to me!
